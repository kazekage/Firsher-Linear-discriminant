# Firsher-Linear-discriminant
This is the code fisher linear discriminant in Python. Data used : https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset. I took
every pair of 2 classes and projected the data in 1D vector space to linearly seperate the classes. Check out the plots at the 
end of code to get a better understanding.
